# Metal-Selector
In this simple machine learning project I used KNN algorithm to make a prediction/suggestion system that can predict an appropriate metal alloy based on mechanical properties such as yield stress and density and also the price range.
The dataset is small and the units are in british system. For GUI I used turtle library and the algorithm is written using numpy & pandas. 
Run Main_Program.py

Purpose of the program:
Let's say you have done tensile test on an unknown ductile material such as a metal and you want to predict what that metal is. Or maybe you have to choose a good material for your industrial activity as a mechanical engineer or a material scientist. This algorithm guesses what the unknown metal can be or which metal can be a perfect choice for your work. SO it works for both prediction and suggestion. Ofcourse the dataset can be bigger and much more better. but it is just an example.
