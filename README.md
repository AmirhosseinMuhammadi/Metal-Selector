# Metal-Selector
In this simple machine learning project I used KNN algorithm to make a prediction/suggestion system that can predict an appropriate metal alloy based on mechanical properties such as yield stress and density and also the price range.
The dataset is small and the units are in british system. For GUI I used turtle library and the algorithm is written using numpy & pandas.
